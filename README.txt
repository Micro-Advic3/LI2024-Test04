# Contact Form Project

This is a contact form that allows users to submit their information. The form includes validation for required fields and a functional email sending feature using EmailJS. Upon successful form submission, a confirmation message is displayed using SweetAlert2.

## Features:
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled out correctly (Name, Email, Phone, Subject, and Message).
- **Email Sending**: Uses EmailJS to send form data to a specified email.
- **Custom Alerts**: SweetAlert2 is used to show success or error messages after form submission.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SweetAlert2 (for custom alerts)
- EmailJS (for sending emails)
